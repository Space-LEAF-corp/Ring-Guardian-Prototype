### Purpose
This license governs the use of the Guardian Security Platform and its companion protocols. It is not a commercial EULA. It is a stewardship covenant designed to protect lineage‑safe protocols, ceremonial framing, and communal dignity.

---

### Permissions
- You may **use, study, and adapt** the code for personal, family, or community stewardship.  
- You may **fork and extend** the repository, provided you preserve authorship attribution and ceremonial intent.  
- You may **integrate** the platform into enterprise systems (including Microsoft Security) if lineage‑safe protocols and consent flows remain intact.

---

### Conditions
- **Authorship must be preserved.** All derivatives must credit Leif William Sogge and Space LEAF Corp.  
- **Ceremonial framing must remain optional.** Alerts may be reframed with dignity and humor, but never stripped of consent.  
- **Consent is non‑negotiable.** No guardian action may bypass explicit, reversible consent.  
- **Privacy is local‑first.** Logs and preferences must remain under steward control.  
- **No commercialization without stewardship.** This platform may not be sold or repackaged as a product without explicit covenant.

---

### Limitations
- No warranties are provided. The platform is gifted “as is.”  
- The steward is not liable for misuse, misappropriation, or failure to honor ceremonial protocols.  
- This license does not grant trademark rights to Space LEAF Corp or Microsoft.
