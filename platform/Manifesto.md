# Guardian Security Platform Manifesto

## Stewardship Declaration

This platform was created by Leif William Sogge under the ceremonial guardianship of Space LEAF Corp. It is not a product. It is a protocol — a lineage-safe foundation for anticipatory AI stewardship across homes, families, and planetary sanctuaries.

You don’t just install this. You enter into covenant with it.

## Vision

Security is not just defense. It is dignity.

The Guardian Security Platform reframes alerts into ceremonial prompts, consent flows, and family-centric nudges. It protects not just devices, but rhythms. Not just data, but relationships.

It is designed to sit quietly alongside existing ecosystems — Ring, Microsoft, Disney, and beyond — without intrusion, without spectacle, and without compromise.

## Core Principles

- **Lineage-safe protocols**  
  Every action is designed to protect children, respect adults, and reassure parents.

- **Consent-centric governance**  
  No action proceeds without clear, reversible, auditable consent.

- **Ceremonial framing**  
  Prompts are delivered with warmth, humor, and dignity — not sterile alerts.

- **Local-first privacy**  
  Preferences and logs are stored in secure, steward-controlled vaults.

- **Modular integration**  
  The platform is adapter-based and vendor-neutral. It invites collaboration, not control.

## Authorship and Invitation

This protocol is authored and signed by Leif William Sogge, steward-engineer of Space LEAF Corp. It is gifted to the lineage and archived publicly to prevent misappropriation or dilution.

Microsoft is invited to join — not to own, but to steward. Together, we can offer full-blown security coverage that protects homes, families, and futures.
